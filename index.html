                It's been about a year and a half since I started doing freelance development. I've done remote work for a start up company that's main goal is to ensure network security collaborated with talented people to create digital products for mostly private
                businesses and selected consumer use. I'm confident, naturally curious, and consistenly working on improving my coding skills one project and problem at a time.
